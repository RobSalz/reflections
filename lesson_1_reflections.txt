Built in command in linux to find the difference betweek two file. giff -u

-u is the unified diff display option


Commits represent logical changes

git log  {lists all the commits ever made, with an commit_id and a description}

git diff {commit_id_1 commit_id_2}

git diff {operates on commits}


If you have multiple files you want to track together, its called a repository.

git log --s {shows all commits, -s gives some statistics, notably +++-------- how much code was added and removed}

git checkout commit_id {temporarily restore a file to how it was}
