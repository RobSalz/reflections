Lesson 2 reflections

git add {adds changes in the working directory to the stagin area to be commited}

git commit -m "commit descrption" {commits the changes that have been staged}

git diff {difference between working directory and the staging area}

git diff --staged {differecne between staged files and last commit}

git reset --hard {revert back to the last commit CAREFULL, will lose all staged and changed work in your working directory}

git log --graph --oneline branch1 branch2 {shows you the different branches being worked on}

git checkout -b new_branch_name {create branch and check it out}

Detached head state, if you checkout a previous commit and edit it. those edits will be lost unless you run the above command that will create a new branch with those changes

when you merge a branch into master, the commits are interleaved based on the date the changes were commited

git show commit_id {if you just want to see the changes between a commit and its parent}
